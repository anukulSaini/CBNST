f(x) is a continuous function in interval [a, b]

@==> if (f(a) * f(b) > 0)==> try again.

@==> if(f(a) * f(b)  ==0 )==> if
{
    (f(a)==0)
       a is root
    }  
    else
    {
      b is root
    } 

@==>if(f(a) * f(b) <0)==> correct interval.


@==>f(a) * f(b) < 0
Steps:

Find middle point c= (a + b)/2 .
If f(c) == 0, then c is the root of the solution.
Else f(c) != 0
  If value f(a)*f(c) < 0 then root lies between a and c. So we recur for a and c
   Else If f(b)*f(c) < 0 then root lies between b and c. So we recur b and c.
    Else given function doesnâ€™t follow one of assumptions.
